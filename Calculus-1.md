## Derivatives

We need to know the following formulas to compute basic derivatives:

$$(e^x)' = e^x
\quad\quad\quad\quad
(ln x)' = 1/x
$$

$$ sin(x)' = cos(x)
\quad\quad\quad\quad 
cos(x)' = - sin(x)
$$

$$(x^n)' = n x^{n-1}$$

And the following rules that allow us to compute more complicated derivatives from simpler ones:

...
