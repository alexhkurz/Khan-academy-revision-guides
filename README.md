# Khan-academy-revision-guides

(this project has been temporarily abandoned ... I will take it up again when I have students who need it)

Khan academy is great resource for learning and revising maths. Nevertheless I can see two disadvantages.

- Khan academy makes learning mathematics slow. 

- Khan academy does not help the students experiencing the joy of doing maths.

Both points are due to the fact that Khan academy breaks down each subject in a very large number of basic skills. Don't get me wrong. This is also the strength of Khan academy. But it makes not a good fit for some purposes.

Here I only address the first item. I plan to put up a number of revision guides, that can be used for students who either need to revise the basic skills of a subject eg for an examination or who just want to get quickly to the most important skills. I call them revision guides, because the selection is not meant to help students actually understanding the maths, rather it aims at giving the quickest access to the most important skills. 

On the other hand, I can also see students who prefer to start learning from the end, first going for the skills and then asking later how it and why it works.
